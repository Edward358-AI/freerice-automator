# freerice-automator
A simple web script to automatically answer questions to farm rice on the website freerice.com

This was inspired by a friend of mine who said he used a script to automatically do it and that got me interested so I did my own take on it. Huge credits to him for the original idea though!

This is by no means the most efficient way to do this, so if anyone has performance increases that would be great.

## Running the script
The script is rather easy to run, although it is currently confined to 1 main category due to other categories being more tedious to code. The category is `Multiplication Table`.

To run the script, open the [multiplication table](https://play.freerice.com/categories/multiplication-table?level=1) category and then run the script in console or as a bookmarklet to start automatically farming rice. NOTE: this script is only designed for multiplication table level 1, so only do it on level 1.
