# freerice-automator
A simple web script to automatically answer questions to farm rice on the website freerice.com

This was inspired by a friend of mine who said he used a script to automatically do it and that got me interested so I did my own take on it. Huge credits to him for the original idea though!

## Running the script
The script is rather easy to run, although it is currently confined to 2 main categories due to other categories being more tedious to code. The two categories are under the Math section, one is `Multiplication Table` and `Basic Math (Pre-Algebra)`.

To run the script, open either the [multiplication table](https://play.freerice.com/categories/multiplication-table?level=1) or the [pre-algebra](https://play.freerice.com/categories/basic-math-pre-algebra?level=1) category and then run the respective script in console or as a bookmarklet to start automatically farming rice. Make sure you are running the correct script depending on the category!!
